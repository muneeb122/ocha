        <h1>The art of noticing</h1>
        <p class="muted subhead">February 28, 2024 ⋅ 280 words</p>
        <p>In a recent No Stupid Questions episode about what really is success, the host mentioned that 5 minutes is about the amount of time that an Olympic gold medalist felt a pure sense of delight after winning the gold medal. Following those 5 minutes came thoughts about what the next goal should be.</p>
            
        <p>There’s this thing that most of us do that makes no sense. We postpone our delight. We schedule our delight for some future milestone– a promotion, a vacation, an olympic gold medal. Of course we don’t do it intentionally, but it happens just the same. And in our postponing, we overlook the delight that spills from ordinary moments leading up to those milestones.</p>
        
        <p>Easy parking in a new place, direct sunlight on the walls, eye wrinkles when smiling, puddles of still water reflecting a bright sky making it look like a portal in the ground, cliantro, covering a baby’s yawn with one finger, a small menu.</p>

        <p>Imagine we payed attention. Imagine we tended to, like a tiny plant requires tending, the ordinary moments in our day. Imagine that sharing a laugh with someone we love and who loves us was the milestone, and that when it happened we had the same sense of radical amazement that we imagine we would have with a promotion, a vacation, an olympic gold medal.</p>

        <p>Now imagine there are hundreds of those moments throughout our day. Maybe thousands. What I’m saying is that there is no future. All we have is this moment, me writing this, you reading it. And this moment contains all the delight we need (ex. seeing in color, the effortlessness with which our hearts beat, a deep breath).</p>
