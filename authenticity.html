        <h1>The new KPI: Authenticity</h1>
        <p class="muted subhead">April 2, 2024 ⋅ 340 words</p>
            <p>We’ve created a world that’s too polished. We need to craft a flawless LinkedIn profile, we need to chase trends on TikTok, we need to optimize ourselves to be liked. We’ve become so calculated that we can’t even tell what feels authentic anymore. We don’t know who we are.</p>
            <p>The popular videos on Youtube are those that were highly edited. They have clever cuts and transitions, they take dozens of hours of raw footage, they require that weird modern phenomenon of putting the camera down walking past then coming back to pick the camera up.</p>
            <p>I loved watching those vlogs. I appreciated the editing, I loved the transitions that lined up with the beat, I marveled in the scenery. But honestly, there’s enough of that now. We’re past it. I think the new type of content that will thrive is We're moving into a new era, one that craves authenticity above all else.The new thing is into a new era where the content that’s appreciated the most is the one that’s most authentic.</p>
            <p>This new era craves authenticity above all else. We need more of that now. More rawness, less editing. We need more people willing to be themselves without fear of being judged. Or doing it despite the fear of being judged. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@zach_pogrob">Zach</a> (obsessed), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/visakanv">Visa</a> (introspection), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/coscorrodrift">Cosco</a> (100vids). We need more people to create content who care less about views and ad revenue and care more about being authentic and saying/doing whatever that leads them to.
            </p>
            <p>That’s where this movement of <a href="https://x.com/muneebsun/status/1774924068455641113?s=20">NC1T videos</a> stems from. No cuts, one take. You sit in front of a camera and you say what’s important to you.</p>
            
            <p>We need to pump Youtube full of this type of authenticity and push out the fake stuff. If we’re able to do that, I think we’ll unlock a type of cohesion and community we’ve never seen before. People who are obsessed with doing what’s authentic to them surrounded by people who are obsessed with doing what’s authentic to them. What would unlock in the world?</p>
