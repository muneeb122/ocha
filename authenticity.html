        <h1>The new KPI: Authenticity</h1>
        <p class="muted subhead">April 2, 2024 ⋅ 340 words</p>
            <p>We’ve created a world that’s too polished. We need to craft a flawless LinkedIn profile, we need to chase trends on TikTok, we need to optimize ourselves to be liked. We’ve become so calculated that we can’t even tell what feels authentic anymore. We don’t know who we are.</p>
            <p>The popular videos on Youtube are those that were highly edited. They have clever cuts and transitions, they take dozens of hours of raw footage, they require that weird modern phenomenon of putting the camera down walking past then coming back to pick the camera up.</p>
            <p>I loved watching those vlogs. I appreciated the editing, the transitions, the scripting. But honestly, there’s enough of that. We’re past it. People crave authenticity above all else.</p>
            <p>We need more rawness. Less editing. We need more people willing to be themselves without (or despite) fear of being judged. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@zach_pogrob">Zach</a> (obsessed), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/visakanv">Visa</a> (introspection), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/coscorrodrift">Cosco</a> (100vids). We need more people to create content who care less about views and ad revenue and care more about being authentic and saying/doing whatever that leads them to.
            </p>
            <p>That’s where this movement of <a href="https://x.com/muneebsun/status/1774924068455641113?s=20">NC1T videos</a> stems from. No cuts, one take. You sit in front of a camera and you say what’s important to you.</p>
            
            <p>We pump the algorithms full of authenticity and push out the fake stuff. Then we'll have a community we’ve never seen before. People who are obsessed with doing what’s authentic to them surrounded by people who are obsessed with doing what’s authentic to them.</p>
