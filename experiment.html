        <p>Your perfectionism is holding you back. You don’t get started on the thing because you’ve already built up this big expectation in your head about how great the thing needs to be.</p>
            
        <p>Now, instead of thinking “this needs to be great”, think “let’s just put it out there and see what happens.”</p>
        <p>The success of an experiment is not dependent on the outcome. In fact, experiments by definition assume that you don’t control the outcome. The whole reason you’re doing the experiment in the first place is to learn something about the outcome.</p>
        <p>A successful experiment is one from which you learn something.
        </p>
        <p>So the next time you're nervous, or procrastinating something, consider this: it's just an experiment. Put it out there and see how it goes. Learn from how it went, make some tweaks, put it out there again. That's life.</p>
